## Template
Create a new repository from [this template repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=ruby-cli-template&template_owner=DPI-WE) to setup a base coding environment to start. Create a meaningful and relevant name for your repo.

## Specifications
Your project must demonstrate the following criteria:

- Your own Ruby class (with an `initialize` method)
- Attributes for an instance variable (eg use `@` with `attr_accessor`, `attr_writer`, `attr_reader`, and/or your own custom getters/setters)
- Accept user input from the terminal:
  - [gets](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/33-the-one-ruby-reference#gets)
  - [chomp](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/33-the-one-ruby-reference#chomp)
- A meaningful repo name with a `README.md` that includes details on what your CLI app does and how to use it.
- Include 1 or 2 tests as described in [Testing your code with MiniTest üß™](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/292-minitest). Be sure to put your test(s) in a folder named `tests/`.
- Include a `functional_spec.md` file in your repository that outlines the functional requirements of your CLI app. This document should include:
  - **Introduction**: Brief description of the application. What problem does it solve, or what functionality does it provide?
  - **User Stories**: Describe the features from the user‚Äôs perspective. For example, `As a [user type], I want to [do something], so that [I achieve some goal]`.
  - And potentially other functional requirements like user interface, commands, etc.

## Examples
- [Calculator CLI](https://github.com/DPI-WE/calculator-cli) - a command line interface app to perform simple arithmetic operations üßÆ
- [Library CLI](https://github.com/heratyian/library-cli) - a command line interface app to simulate a library üìö
- [Garage CLI](https://github.com/Dantexkilljoy/garage-cli) - a command line app to simulate a valet parking garage üöó
- [Pet Cat CLI](https://github.com/jptran0/cat-cli) - a command line interface app to simulate a pet cat üêà
- [Dad Jokes](https://github.com/Meenoow/dad-jokes-cli) - a command line interface to simulate a dad saving jokes to use later on a waitress at an Olive Garden üë¥
- [Chefapp CLI](https://github.com/Gomezzzer/chefapp) - a command line interface app to simulate a chef adding items to a menu üçù

## What to submit
Submit a GitHub URL. Make sure your GitHub repository has a name reflective of what the code does.

- Enter your `github.com/username/project-name` GitHub repository URL:
- github.com
  - Great job!
- any
  - Not quite. Make sure the URL looks like: `https://github.com/username/project-name`
{: .free_text #github_repo_url title="GitHub repository URL" points="1" answer="1" }


<div class="alert alert-danger mt-2">

After you submit the URL here, return to Canvas and submit the URL again in the assignment "Submit your CLI GitHub project URL".

An instructor will provide additional feedback on your submission there.
