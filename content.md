# Command Line Interface (CLI) Project
In this assignment you'll create a command-line interface (CLI) application with a custom-defined defined Ruby class

## Template
Create a new repository from [this template repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=ruby-cli-template&template_owner=DPI-WE) to setup a base coding environment to start. Create a meaningful and relevant name for your repo.

## Specifications
Your project must demonstrate the following criteria:

- Your own Ruby class (with an `initialize` method)
- Attributes for an instance variable (eg use `@` with `attr_accessor`, `attr_writer`, `attr_reader`, and/or your own custom getters/setters)
- Accept user input from the terminal:
  - [gets](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/33-the-one-ruby-reference#gets)
  - [chomp](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/33-the-one-ruby-reference#chomp)
- A meaningful repo name with a `README.md` that includes details on what your CLI app does and how to use it.
- Include 1 or 2 tests as described in [Testing your code with MiniTest 🧪](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/292-minitest). Be sure to put your test(s) in a folder named `tests/`.
- Include a `functional_spec.md` file in your repository that outlines the functional requirements of your CLI app. This document should include:
  - **Introduction**: Brief description of the application. What problem does it solve, or what functionality does it provide?
  - **User Stories**: Describe the features from the user’s perspective. For example, `As a [user type], I want to [do something], so that [I achieve some goal]`.
  - And potentially other functional requirements like user interface, commands, etc.

## Examples

- [Garage CLI](https://github.com/Dantexkilljoy/garage-cli) - a command line app to simulate a valet parking garage 🚗
- [Pet Cat CLI](https://github.com/jptran0/cat-cli) - a command line interface app to simulate a pet cat 🐈
- [Dad Jokes](https://github.com/Meenoow/dad-jokes-cli) - a command line interface to simulate a dad saving jokes to use later on a waitress at an Olive Garden 👴
- [Chefapp CLI](https://github.com/Gomezzzer/chefapp) - a command line interface app to simulate a chef adding items to a menu 🍝

## What to submit
